# Seasons - A Swift-Playground

An interactive playground built to celebrate the onset of spring season. An audio visual scene containing a cherry blossom tree symbolizing the spring. The background score gives the feeling of being in a garden with birds chirping. When the user taps on the tree, flowers and leaves fall from it and get collected on the ground.
